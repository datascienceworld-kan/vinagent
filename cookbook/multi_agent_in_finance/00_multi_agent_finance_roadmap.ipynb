    "# Multi-Agent in Finance: Development Roadmap\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the **Multi-Agent in Finance** series. This roadmap outlines the progression from basic sequential agents to state-of-the-art institutional-grade financial systems using the **Vinagent** library.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Principles\n",
    "- **Framework**: [Vinagent](https://github.com/vinagent/vinagent)\n",
    "- **Orchestration**: `CrewAgent` + `FlowStateGraph`\n",
    "- **Modularity**: agents built as `AgentNode` instances\n",
    "- **State Management**: Shared `TypedDict` across all agents"
