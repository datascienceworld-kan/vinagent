It provides a comprehensive set of components for building agents, including: Model, Tool, Graph Memory, Workflow, and Observability.</p> <p></p> <p>The following are specifically designed components:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Tools: Supports a variety of different tools, from user-implemented tools like Function tool and Module tool, to tools from the MCP market. Thus, Vinagent ensures you always have all the necessary features and data for every task.</p> </li> <li> <p>Memory: Vinagent organizes the short-term and long-term memory of the Agent through graph storage, creating a graph network that compresses information more efficiently than traditional conversation history storage. This innovative approach helps Vinagent save memory and minimize hallucination.</p> </li> <li> <p>Planning and Control: Based on the graph foundation of Langgraph, Vinagent designs workflows with simpler syntax, using the right shift <code>&gt;&gt;</code> operator, which is easy to use for beginers. This makes creating and managing complex workflows much simpler compared to other agent workflow libraries, even for a complex conditional and parallel workflows.</p> </li> <li> <p>Personalize user Experience: Vinagent supports inference through three methods: asynchronous, synchronous, and streaming. This flexibility allows you to speed up processing and improve user experience when applying agents in AI products that require fast and immediate processing speeds.</p> </li> <li> <p>Security: Vinagent ensures AI Agent security through OAuth 2.0 authentication, a protocol that allows third-party applications to access Agent resources without exposing any user's credentials. This approach uses access token instread of direct user/password authentication. It works by orchestrating these participants.</p> </li> <li> <p>Prompt Optimization: Vinagent integrates automatic prompt optimization features, enhancing accuracy for Agents. This ensures the Agent operates effectively even with specialized tasks. Observability: Allows monitoring of the Agent\u2019s processing information on-premise and is compatible with Jupyter Notebook. You can measure total processing time, the number of input/output tokens, as well as LLM model information at each step in the workflow. This detailed observability feature is crucial for debugging and optimizing the Agent.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#support-multi-agent","title":"Support Multi-agent","text":"<p>Vinagent designs an advanced multi-agent solution with key strengths:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Specialized Agents: Each single agent is fully equipped with its own LLM, tools, memory, skills, and authentication layer.</p> </li> <li> <p>Shared Conversation: Agents collaborate seamlessly in the same conversation, enabling them to capture and utilize each other\u2019s context.</p> </li> <li> <p>Human-in-the-Loop: Users can directly participate and interact within the agent workflow.</p> </li> <li> <p>Customizable Order: A Crew class allows flexible control over the sequence of agents in a conversation.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#vinagent-ecosystem","title":"Vinagent ecosystem","text":"<p>Although <code>Vinagent</code> can stand as a independent library for agent, it is designed to be integrated with other Vinagent's Ecosystem libraries that expands its capabilities rather than just a simple Agent.

An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\nTask Decomposition#\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to \u201cthink step by step\u201d to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model\u2019s thinking process.\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\n\nDocument 2:\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can't be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\n\nDocument 3:\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into \u201cProblem PDDL\u201d, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing \u201cDomain PDDL\u201d, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\nSelf-Reflection#\n\nDocument 4:\nResources:\n1.

According to Document 1, this can be achieved through techniques such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts, which involve instructing a model to \"think step by step\" and explore multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. Additionally, Document 3 mentions that task decomposition can be done using simple prompting, task-specific instructions, or human inputs, as well as relying on an external classical planner using the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL).

The trending of the chart: The overall trend of the chart is upward, indicating a steady increase in the stock price over the given period. The 'close' price starts at around $5.97 in 2020 and reaches approximately $157.75 by June 2025.\n\n2. The percentage increase or decrease in price: To calculate the percentage change, we compare the initial and final 'close' prices. The initial 'close' price is around $5.97, and the final 'close' price is approximately $157.75. The percentage increase can be calculated as ((157.75 - 5.97) / 5.97) * 100, which is roughly 2541%. This indicates a substantial increase in the stock price over the five-year period.\n\n3. Opinion about the future price: Based on historical data, it's challenging to predict future stock prices with certainty.

Successive UK governments and the independent 2012 Airports Commission concluded that additional airport capacity in southeast England was needed by 2030. After extensive public and expert consultation, the Government issued a draft National Policy Statement (NPS) under the Planning Act 2008, culminating in the Airports NPS (ANPS) in June 2018. Objectors\u2014Friends of the Earth and Plan B Earth\u2014claimed the Secretary of State unlawfully ignored the Paris Agreement\u2019s temperature targets, failed to explain how the ANPS aligned with Government climate policy (section 5(8)), lacked proper regard for climate change mitigation (section 10), and breached the Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive by omitting non-CO\u2082 impacts and post-2050 emissions. The Divisional Court refused permission, finding the Secretary of State had rationally relied on the Climate Change Act 2008 and expert advice from the Committee on Climate Change. The Court of Appeal overturned that decision, declaring the ANPS legally ineffective. HAL then appealed to the Supreme Court, which allowed HAL\u2019s appeal. The Supreme Court held that neither the Paris Agreement nor unquantified non-CO\u2082 or post-2050 emissions were \u201cobviously material\u201d legal requirements at the policy-setting stage and that the ANPS had lawfully discharged statutory duties.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"guides/legal_assistant/#timeline-and-fact-organization","title":"Timeline and Fact Organization","text":"<p>We can organize the timeline of events for each legal case in reverse chronological order to enhance tracking efficiency.

For each ground I identify what I see as the chief strengths of HAL\u2019s position and the major vulnerabilities in FoE/Plan B\u2019s counter-arguments.\n\n1. Ground (i): Section 5(8) PA 2008 \u2013 \u201cDuty to explain how the NPS takes account of Government climate policy\u201d  \n   HAL\u2019s argument  \n   \u2022 Parliament fixed the UK\u2019s carbon-reduction commitment in the Climate Change Act 2008.  That target (80 % by 2050, later 100 %) and the process for adjusting it are entrenched in statute.  The ANPS properly explained how it took that settled policy into account (paras 5.71\u20135.73).  Anything beyond that\u2014e.g. aspirational global temperature goals in the Paris Agreement\u2014was not \u201cGovernment policy\u201d in the sense of an established, unqualified domestic statement of policy.  \n   Strengths  \n   \u2013 Textual: section 5(8) looks to \u201cGovernment policy\u201d already laid down.  Treaties in force but not given domestic effect\u2014and ministerial utterances that flag only an intention to return to Parliament later\u2014do not qualify.  \n   \u2013 Context and purpose: NPS explanations must avoid endless trawls through speeches, consultation responses or emerging international commitments.  They must stick to clear, binding domestic policy statements.  \n   Weaknesses for FoE/Plan B  \n   \u2013 They relied on loose ministerial remarks in early 2016 and on the Paris Agreement\u2019s temperature goal.  Those neither created binding UK law nor amounted to an unqualified Government policy of the kind that section 5(8) demands.  \n   \u2013 Invoking aspirational treaty aims would impose a burden on NPS drafters to catalogue every \u201cpolicy\u201d mention in White Papers, Commons Statements, press releases, etc., leading to unpredictability.\n\n2. Ground (ii): Section 10 PA 2008 \u2013 \u201cHave regard to mitigation/adaptation\u201d  \n   HAL\u2019s argument  \n   \u2022 Section 10 requires the Secretary of State to aim for sustainable development, including mitigating/adapting to climate change, but gives a broad margin of judgment as to which material considerations to weigh and the weight to give them.  The ANPS addressed the UK\u2019s binding obligations under the Climate Change Act, which already give effect to the Paris Agreement NDCs.  The Paris Agreement itself is not extra domestic law and needed no separate treatment.  \n   Strengths  \n   \u2013 Well-settled Wednesbury principle: dehors express statutory direction, a decision-maker need not catalogue every possible international commitment.  Unless omission is irrational, it is lawful.  \n   \u2013 The ANPS did address greenhouse gases, carbon budgets, and required that any DCO application demonstrate consistency with whatever targets applied at that later date.  \n   Weaknesses for FoE/Plan B  \n   \u2013 Their approach conflated international treaty goals with domestic law obligations.  They could not show that the Secretary of State\u2019s refusal even arguable lacked \u201creasonableness\u201d or was outside his wide discretion.  \n   \u2013 To impose a free-standing duty to re-examine global aims would overstep parliament\u2019s careful design of carbon-budget review processes in the 2008 Act.\n\n3. Ground (iii): SEA Directive \u2013 \u201cAdequacy of the Environmental Report\u201d  \n   HAL\u2019s argument  \n   \u2022 The strategic environmental assessment (SEA) for the draft ANPS took the Airports Commission\u2019s extensive work (including all carbon scenarios) as its baseline.  It quantified CO\u2082 and recorded that non-CO\u2082 effects were uncertain and could not yet be sensibly modelled.  Under Articles 5(2)\u2013(3) SEA (and transposing regs), the Secretary of State had a broad discretion to decide what \u201creasonably may be required\u201d in an environmental report.  The public was consulted and responses on climate matters were taken into account.  \n   Strengths  \n   \u2013 Blewett/Wednesbury standard: environmental reports need only supply a sufficient basis for public consultation, not endless academic coverage of every hypothetical.  \n   \u2013 The public consultation process did solicit comments on climate goals; the report and ANPS responded.  \n   Weaknesses for FoE/Plan B  \n   \u2013 Their claim rested on a judicial curiosity\u2014that the Paris Agreement should have been named in the scoping list.  But law and policy on aviation emissions were evolving; the report explained clearly why non-CO\u2082 effects were deferred for future, more detailed work.  \n   \u2013 Under EU law as under domestic law, the SEA Directive tolerates an iterative and proportionate approach.\n\n4. Ground (iv): Section 10(3) PA 2008 \u2013 \u201cPost-2050 and Non-CO\u2082 Emissions\u201d  \n   HAL\u2019s argument  \n   \u2022 The ANPS (and its AoS) modelled airport emissions through 2085/86 and quantified all CO\u2082 emissions (pre- and post-2050).  They explained that post-2050 policy settings and future carbon budgets would govern any DCO, and that non-CO\u2082 climate impacts are scientifically uncertain and not yet regulated.  Those matters will be addressed in the forthcoming Aviation Strategy and at the DCO stage.  It was neither irrational nor procedurally defective to defer them.  \n   Strengths  \n   \u2013 The ANPS spelled out the requirement that any DCO applicant show consistency with \u201cthen current\u201d targets.  There is a built-in safety valve (section 104 PA 2008) permitting refusal if future obligations would be breached.  \n   \u2013 Reasonable scientific uncertainty about non-CO\u2082 forcings, and absence of an agreed metric, justified a focused CO\u2082 assessment now and detailed post-2030 work later.  \n   Weaknesses for FoE/Plan B  \n   \u2013 Invoking a notional \u201cnet zero\u201d objective for post-2050 emissions would have required guesses about legislation not yet in place.  That cannot render a policy statement unlawful.  \n   \u2013 Their critique collapses into an argument for pre-deciding a DCO refusal point far in advance of any application, blurring the line between NPS-making and DCO decision-making.\n\nOverall conclusion  \n   HAL\u2019s key legal strength across all grounds is that Parliament deliberately embedded UK carbon commitments in the Climate Change Act framework, prescribing a process for adjusting them.  Neither the Paris Agreement\u2019s aspirational temperature goals nor emerging Aviation Strategy work constituted binding domestic policy or mandatory inputs at the NPS-making stage.  The courts below (Divisional Court, then Sup Ct on appeal) correctly recognized the broad discretion and margin of judgment that the PA 2008 and SEA regime afford to decision-makers on these complex, evolving climate issues.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"guides/legal_assistant/#jurisdictional-analysis","title":"Jurisdictional Analysis","text":"<p>Jurisdictional analysis is vital in legal proceedings to ensure challenges are pursued correctly and efficiently.

The jurisdictional framework can be broken down as follows:\n\n1.   Statutory basis for challenge (PA 2008 s 13)  \n     \u2013  Section 13(1) of the Planning Act 2008 provides the *only* route by which an NPS may be questioned in the courts: by way of a claim for judicial review.  \n     \u2013  It must be brought within six weeks from the later of (a) the date of designation of the NPS or (b) its publication.\n\n2.   Procedural history  \n     \u2013  Objectors (Friends of the Earth, Plan B Earth and others) filed judicial review proceedings in the High Court challenging the Secretary of State\u2019s decision under s 5(1) to designate the ANPS.  \n     \u2013  The Divisional Court (Hickinbottom LJ and Holgate J) heard all of the claims on a \u201crolled-up\u201d basis (i.e. permission and merits together) and dismissed every ground.  \n     \u2013  The objectors appealed under the statutory right of appeal from a JR decision to the Court of Appeal.  That court allowed two of the grounds, quashed the designation, and said the ANPS was of no legal effect unless and until remedial steps were taken.  \n     \u2013  Heathrow Airport Ltd (HAL) (joined as an interested party below) then obtained permission to appeal to the Supreme Court under s 40(1) of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005.\n\n3.   Scope of judicial review jurisdiction  \n     \u2013  Subject-matter jurisdiction: only the lawfulness of the NPS designation itself (and the procedures leading up to it) could be reviewed, not the merits of airport expansion or technical climate policy.  \n     \u2013  Time limit: six weeks under PA 2008 s 13(1).  \n     \u2013  Remedies: the court can quash the designation or grant declarations (but not award damages).  The Secretary of State could then (and still can) choose to re-designate the ANPS after remedying any procedural or legal defects.\n\n4.   Relationship to other statutory provisions  \n     \u2013  Senior Courts Act 1981 s 31 gives the High Court (and Divisional Court) general JR jurisdiction; PA 2008 s 13 is a carve-out stipulating the subject and time limit for NPS challenges.  \n     \u2013  No ordinary \u201cappeal\u201d lies against an NPS under PA 2008 s 9\u2014only JR under s 13.  \n     \u2013  Once an NPS is in force, applications for Development Consent Orders under PA 2008 Part 6 must be determined \u201cin accordance with\u201d the NPS (s 104), subject to limited exceptions.\n\n5.   Final leave and outcome  \n     \u2013  HAL, as an interested party with a substantial investment in the NWR proposal, was granted leave to defend the validity of the ANPS in the Supreme Court.  \n     \u2013  The Supreme Court\u2019s ultimate task is purely to resolve the legal questions of statutory interpretation and public-law review raised by the appeal.\n\nIn short, the courts\u2019 jurisdiction in this case sprang from the Planning Act\u2019s carefully circumscribed JR regime for national policy statements (PA 2008 s 13), carried through the Divisional Court, Court of Appeal and now the Supreme Court, with all stakeholders bound by the six-week time bar and limited to questions of law and procedure.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"guides/legal_assistant/#ethical-and-bias-in-court-ruling","title":"Ethical and Bias in court ruling","text":"<p>Court rulings need to be ethical and free from bias to deliver fair, open, and responsible decisions, especially in tricky cases while many unfair judgements were made.

Intergenerational and global justice  \n\u2022   Duty to future generations:  Expanding Heathrow locks in additional carbon emissions for decades.

There is a moral question whether it ought to go beyond its 2050 carbon ceiling (and take non-CO\u2082 effects into account) so as to set a leadership example globally.\n\n2. Weighing economic gains vs. environmental harms  \n\u2022   Distributional impact on local communities:  The project will bring noise, air pollution and property blight to residents under flight paths. An ethical analysis probes whether their health and quality-of-life costs have been fairly balanced against national GDP growth and passenger convenience.  \n\u2022   Procedural fairness:  Did the consultation and environmental assessment processes genuinely empower affected communities to shape or challenge the policy, or were they a box-ticking exercise that privileged central government\u2019s economic case?\n\n3. Transparency and reason-giving  \n\u2022   Climate rationale omitted:  The Court of Appeal found the Secretary of State failed to explain how the ANPS policy aligned with the Paris goals; the Supreme Court later said that omission did not cross the threshold of irrationality. Ethically, stakeholders argue the public deserves an explicit account of how airport expansion sits alongside the U.K.\u2019s broader commitments to limit warming to \u201cwell below 2 \u00b0C.\u201d  \n\u2022   Trust in expert advice:  Relying heavily on the Airports Commission and the Committee on Climate Change can seem to bias decision-making toward technical or economic expertise while sidelining lay and community values around environmental precaution.\n\n4. Use of the precautionary principle vs. innovation optimism  \n\u2022   Precautionary stance:  Some ethicists argue that \u201cscientific uncertainty\u201d over non-CO\u2082 impacts and post-2050 emissions should have triggered a precautionary moratorium until tighter metrics and policies were in place.  \n\u2022   Innovation and efficiency view:  Government and HAL contend that technology improvements (more fuel-efficient aircraft, carbon trading, sustainable aviation fuels) will allow capacity growth without breaching climate targets\u2014an ethically forward-looking, solution-driven stance.\n\n5. Institutional and cognitive biases  \n\u2022   Status-quo momentum (\u201cpath-dependency\u201d):  Heathrow has long been a focal point of U.K. aviation policy. Ethically, decision-makers may be unduly anchored to existing infrastructure and past studies rather than re-evaluating fundamental climate and social trade-offs.  \n\u2022   Framing and risk perception:  By characterizing carbon emissions as \u201cnot a reason to refuse consent unless material,\u201d the ANPS frames climate risk as secondary, which can bias assessments against deeply weighting environmental uncertainties.\n\n6. Judicial deference vs. rights-protecting oversight  \n\u2022   Deference to political branches:  The Supreme Court majority accepted that the Secretary of State\u2019s policy judgments\u2014even if contestable\u2014were not irrational. Some critics see this as ethically problematic deference that weakens environmental accountability.  \n\u2022   Activist impulse:  Conversely, the Court of Appeal\u2019s willingness to quash the ANPS for failure to expressly link to Paris raised questions about the proper reach of judicial review and the democratic mandate of Parliamentarians who voted in support.\n\nIn sum, this ruling sits at the intersection of competing ethical claims\u2014economic growth and social opportunity versus climate justice and community well-being\u2014and highlights how technical advice, statutory formulations and institutional roles can introduce biases in how those claims are weighed.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"guides/paper_research/","title":"Academic Paper Research with vinagent","text":"<p>Contributor: Thanh Lam</p> <p></p> <p>In this tutorial, let's study Researcher Agent, which is an AI-powered tool designed to streamline the process of academic research by leveraging the vast repository of papers on arXiv.

Stock Be in 10 Years? - Yahoo Finance\n## What is new?\nNvidia's generative AI business is still performing well, but there are signs of slowing growth. The company's revenue growth has decelerated to 69% from 262% in the previous fiscal quarter. Additionally, new technologies like self-driving cars and robotics could be key to Nvidia's long-term success, with potential annual revenue of $300 billion to $400 billion by 2035 for self-driving technology and $38 billion for humanoid robots.\n\n## Highlight\nThe key points of the article include: Nvidia's data center business represents 89% of its total revenue, the company's AI chip business may be slowing down, and new business verticals like robotics and self-driving cars could help diversify Nvidia's revenue streams. The company's automation and robotics segment has already shown significant growth, with first-quarter sales jumping 72% year over year to $567 million.\n\n## Why it matters\nThe potential slowing down of Nvidia's AI chip business and the company's ability to pivot to new technologies will have a significant impact on its long-term success. If Nvidia can successfully transition to new business verticals, it could maintain its dominant position in the market and continue to thrive. However, if it fails to adapt to changing conditions, it may experience stagnation or decline, as has been the case with other companies that have failed to evolve with technological advancements.\n\n## Link\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/where-nvidia-stock-10-years-200000792.html\n\n# Nvidia's latest DLSS revision reduces VRAM usage by 20% for upscaling \u2014 optimizations reduce overhead of more powerful transformer model - Tom's Hardware\n## What is new?\nNvidia has released a new revision of its DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) technology, which reduces VRAM usage by 20% for upscaling. This update optimizes the transformer model, making it more efficient and reducing its memory footprint. The new revision, DLSS 310.3.0, improves the transformer model's VRAM usage, bringing it closer to the older CNN model's memory impact.\n\n## Highlight\nThe key points of this update include:\n* 20% reduction in VRAM usage for upscaling\n* Optimizations reduce the overhead of the more powerful transformer model\n* The new transformer model consumes 40% more memory than the CNN model, down from nearly twice as much\n* Memory consumption increases linearly with resolution, with the transformer model consuming 85.77MB of VRAM at 1080p and 307.37MB at 4K\n\n## Why it matters\nThis update is significant because it shows Nvidia's commitment to improving the efficiency of its DLSS technology. While the 20% reduction in VRAM usage may not have a noticeable impact on real-world applications, it demonstrates the company's efforts to optimize its technology for better performance. Additionally, the reduction in memory footprint could be beneficial for systems with limited VRAM, particularly at higher resolutions like 8K. This update also highlights the ongoing development and refinement of DLSS, which is now used in over 760 games and apps.\n\n## Link\nhttps://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidias-latest-dlss-revision-reduces-vram-usage-by-20-percent-for-upscaling-optimizations-reduce-overhead-of-more-powerful-transformer-model\n\n# Nvidia executives cash out $1bn worth of shares - Financial Times\n## What is new?\nNvidia executives have recently sold a substantial amount of shares, totaling $1 billion in value. This significant transaction has drawn attention to the company's internal dynamics and potential future directions.\n\n## Highlight\nThe key points of this news include the large-scale sale of Nvidia shares by its executives, amounting to $1 billion. This move could indicate a shift in the executives' confidence in the company's future prospects or a strategic decision to diversify their personal investments.\n\n## Why it matters\nThe sale of such a large volume of shares by Nvidia executives could have implications for investor confidence and the company's stock price. It may also signal potential changes in Nvidia's leadership or strategy, as significant insider transactions often attract scrutiny from investors and market analysts. Understanding the motivations behind this sale can provide insights into the company's future growth prospects and industry trends.\n\n## Link\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/36f346ad-c649-42ac-a6b6-1a8cc881e0bb\n\n# Nvidia: The Music Is About To Stop (NASDAQ:NVDA) - Seeking Alpha\n## What is new?\nThe article discusses the potential risks and challenges facing Nvidia Corporation, including macro and geopolitical risks, rising competition, and their potential impact on the company's performance. The authors, Bears of Wall Street, maintain a bearish stance on NVDA stock, citing these factors as reasons to sell.\n\n## Highlight\nThe key points of the article include:\n* Nvidia's stock has risen around 15% since the last coverage before its Q1 earnings report\n* Macro and geopolitical risks could have a significant impact on Nvidia's performance\n* Rising competition may lead to lower demand for Nvidia's products in the future\n* The authors recommend a \"Sell\" position on NVDA stock due to these and other factors\n\n## Why it matters\nThe article's analysis matters because it highlights the potential risks and challenges that Nvidia faces, which could impact the company's future growth and profitability. Investors who are considering buying or holding NVDA stock should be aware of these risks and consider the authors' bearish stance when making their investment decisions. Additionally, the article's focus on macro and geopolitical risks, as well as rising competition, underscores the importance of considering broader market trends and industry dynamics when evaluating individual stocks.\n\n## Link\nhttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4797785-nvidia-the-music-is-about-to-stop\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"reference/agent/","title":"Agent Definitions","text":""},{"location":"reference/agent/#vinagent.agent.agent.Agent","title":"Agent","text":"<p>               Bases: <code>AgentMeta</code></p> <p>The Agent class is a concrete implementation of an AI agent with tool-calling capabilities, inheriting from AgentMeta.
